 PROJECT NAME : MealMender - An AI powered platfrom to fix the problem of food wastage.

SELECTED DOMAIN : Web Development.

PROBLEM STATEMENT / USE CASE :
      The problem statement that we choose to present is the "ZERO WASTE - An AI powered geo-intelligent food Donating and Rescue system." It is about the way that we can develop a web platform that hepls us to reduce the wastage of food by establishing a bridge between Donors and Recipients.

ABSTRACT / PROBLEM DESCRIPTION : 
      Food waste is a growing problem we see all around us—leftovers from restaurants, canteens, and even homes often end up in the trash. Meanwhile, many people struggle to get a single proper meal. This gap between excess and need is what inspired us to create MEALMENDER.

MEALMENDER is a web platform designed to connect food donors with people who need it. Donors—like restaurants, households, or canteens—can sign up, share what food they have, and add details like quantity, quality, and their location.

Recipients—such as NGOs, shelters, or individuals—can also register, view nearby donations, and request food based on what’s available and convenient for them. They can consider things like freshness, distance, and time of donation before making a choice. Once a request is accepted by the donor, the recipient gets a confirmation and can collect the food.

An admin panel helps track overall impact, like food saved and people served.

With MEALMENDER, our goal is simple: reduce food waste and make sure good food reaches those who need it most.
